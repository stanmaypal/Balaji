        Balaji Academy Gorakhpur was established on 25th August, 1969 by the managing committee constituted under Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad, Gorakhpur. It is situated in civil lines, the heart of Gorakhpur city in east Uttar Pradesh. Days are not far when the college shall be able to realize the vision and the grand mission of the great soul 'Brahmleen Mahanth Digvijai Nath ji Maharaj', whose name decorates the identity of the College.

His Holiness 'Brahmleen Digvijai Nathji Maharaj, former Head Priest of worldfame Shree Guru Gorakshnath Temple, Gorakhpur was the founder of the college. He was a pioneer of educational renaissance in Eastern U.P. It was none other than himself who established Maha Rana Pratap Shiksha Parishad, Gorakhpur in 1932 to spread the light of knowledge and awareness among the people of Eastern U.P. whom he found to be living in utter poverty, ignorance and backwardness of all kinds. He came to Gorakhnath temple, Gorakhpur at the age of five from the Royal Rana Family of Mewar, Rajasthan in 1900 and grew and learnt the lesson of selfless sacrifice and dedication to the service of humanity under the spiritual care of his accomplished great Guru Yogiraj Gambhir Nathji Maharaj. In 1949-50 Maharana Pratap Degree College was established by "Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad Gorakhpur", which was later sacrificed to contribute to the establishment of Gorakhpur University. Maharana Pratap Degree College along with its entire infrastructure including teaching and non-teaching staff was dedicated to count for the resources to meet up the requirements for establishment of the University of Gorakhpur, in 1958.

Post-merger of the Maharana Pratap Degree College into Gorakhpur University, there was a vacuum in the educational facilities of the area. To fill in this vacuum, Digvijai Nath College was established on 25th August 1969. Now the administration of this college is run by the managing committee appointed by Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad, Gorakhpur, under inspiring guidance and patronage of His Holiness Mahant Avedya Nathji Maharaj. His holiness Gorakshpeethadheeshwar 'Brahmleen Avedya Nathji Maharaj (the Ex-Head priest of Gorakhnath Temple) and his worthy successor who is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh is the His Holiness reverent Yogi Aditya Nath ji maharaj, is the guiding light behind more than three dozen institutions, including D.N.P.G. College Gorakhpur, successfully run by the Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parisad. The College holds the glory of functioning with four faculty disciplines covering various departments at undergraduate and post graduate levels. College provides education at graduate level in eleven subjects covering Arts, six in Science and Commerce. Post Graduate teaching is offered in Ancient History Archeology & Culture, Geography and Hindi & Modern Indian Language; apart from its renowned Bachelors in Education. In addition to these, part time classes in eight non-practical subjects are also offered and the Institution also serves as an education center of Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University; and hosts their 26 coursesat U.G and P.G. level.
